# Team-Profile-Generator

For this assignment, we were instructed to create a Team Profile Generator that a user would answer questions in node, & the answers would create an HTML document with the team information. There was some starter code given, and tests laid out. We had to make sure that we created classes and the app.js document functions that would properly generate the HTML document.
